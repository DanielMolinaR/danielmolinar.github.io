      <description>The project I undertook involved the development of a comprehensive CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system tailored specifically for a physiotherapy clinic. The primary objective was to create an integrated toolset capable of streamlining the management processes associated with users, appointments, and prescribed exercises, ultimately enhancing the clinic&amp;rsquo;s operational efficiency and service quality.&#xA;This CRM system caters to three distinct user categories: patients, employees, and administrators. Each category has been endowed with specific privileges and access levels within the system.</description>
