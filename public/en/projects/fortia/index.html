          CRM for physiotherapy clinic

    <p>The project I undertook involved the development of a comprehensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRM</a> (Customer Relationship Management) system tailored specifically for a physiotherapy clinic. The primary objective was to create an integrated toolset capable of streamlining the management processes associated with users, appointments, and prescribed exercises, ultimately enhancing the clinic&rsquo;s operational efficiency and service quality.</p>
<p>This CRM system caters to three distinct user categories: <strong>patients, employees, and administrators</strong>. Each category has been endowed with <strong>specific privileges and access levels within the system</strong>. Administrators enjoy comprehensive control over user management, appointment scheduling, and exercise administration. Employees, on the other hand, are tasked with managing appointments and patient-related activities assigned to them, whereas patients have the autonomy to oversee their individual appointment bookings, exercise regimens, and personal account details.</p>
<p>Security is of paramount importance, and as such, an array of measures has been implemented to safeguard sensitive data. These include <strong>token-based authentication mechanisms</strong> as defined in the protocol <a href="https://oauth.net/2/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OAuth2.0</a>, data encryption protocols, and email verification procedures for new user registrations, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of information stored within the system.</p>
<p>The development of the application involved a bifurcated approach encompassing both <a href="https://github.com/DanielMolinaR/front-fisioterapia"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frontend</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DanielMolinaR/API-REST"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backend</a> components. Vuetify, a Vue.js-based material design framework, was employed for crafting the frontend interface. Leveraging Vuetify facilitated the creation of an intuitive, visually appealing <strong>reponsive</strong> user interface that seamlessly adapts to various devices, be it <strong>desktops or mobile devices</strong>. Meanwhile, the backend logic was constructed using <strong>Go</strong>, a programming language renowned for its performance and concurrency capabilities. Communication between the frontend and the backend is done through a <strong>RESTful API</strong>, which is responsible for handling requests and responses between both parties.</p>
<p>The database used to store the application information is <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, which offers robustness and security in data management. In addition, <strong>KeyCloak</strong> was integrated for user account management and the generation of access tokens and refresh tokens, following the OAuth 2.0 protocol to guarantee security in user authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the application was engineered as a <strong>Progressive Web Application (PWA)</strong>, endowing it with native-like capabilities and enabling users to install it directly onto their mobile devices via a web browser. This implementation grants users the convenience of offline access and push notifications, enhancing overall user experience and accessibility.</p>
<p>In summation, the project represents a successful endeavor in the realm of physiotherapy clinic management, characterized by a meticulous focus on security, usability, and cross-device compatibility. By harnessing advanced technologies and adhering to best practices in software development, the CRM system offers a robust solution tailored to the specific needs of the healthcare sector.</p>
