<p>Padel Shop is a web shop focused on selling padel goods such as rackets, clothes and other products. Padel Shop&rsquo;s website is one of the leading online destinations for all things related to padel sport, catering to a diverse community of enthusiasts and professionals alike. With the here presented idea the process of shopping a padel racket would be easier and more engaging with the end customer leading to an <strong>improvement in sales and a better user experience and decision-making which will translate in customers&rsquo; loyalty and competitors differentiation</strong>. This project overview outlines a strategy to seamlessly integrate the idea into the offerings of PadelShop.com.</p>

</h2>
<p>Buying a padel racket is not an easy decision. They can be expensive and once you used it for the first time you cannot return it. Therefore, customers expend long hours researching the best racket for them and which one is best tailored to their play style. While pursuing an end goal of improving the customer experience and decision-making hereby is offered a solution which will fulfill those needs. With a <strong>custom-made scatter graph</strong> over an organized layout and where each racket would take place depending on some useful game play measurements, the end customers would be able to filter rackets depending on their needs and desires.</p>
<div>
    <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="/assets/images/padelshop/graph-example.PNG"  alt="Graph example" width="500"/>
        <figcaption>Example - rackets graph</figcaption>
    <figure>
</div>
<p>The graph, filters and a list of the actual rackets represented in the graph would be added in Padelshop website allowing the users to enhance their ideal padel racket research. This way the users would apply filters depending on their needs and while hovering over each remaining padel racket in the graph or going to the bottom list the user would be able to read a small piece of information about the racket and click it to be redirected to the end product. Furthermore, this latest connectivity will <strong>improve the sales funnel</strong> by offering better results to the clients and <strong>gamify the sales target</strong> while <strong>keeping the website&rsquo;s SEO in line</strong>.</p>
<div>
    <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="/assets/images/padelshop/website-mockup.PNG"  alt="website-mockup" width="500"/>
        <figcaption>Website's mockup</figcaption>
    <figure>
</div>
<p>For this idea to become true, <strong>multiple approaches</strong> can be taken, although, after some research and building proofs of concept <strong>most of them led to the need of an user interface integration</strong> in the current padelshop website. This new user interface entry will display a filter bar, the graph and list of rackets filtered. This approach is already counting into padelshop&rsquo;s current design. <strong>The user interface will enable customer interaction</strong> and enhance the shopping experience without the functionality of rackets management nor for customers either the site owner.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this proposal you would find <strong>two different approaches</strong>. One which involves just the user interface integration but with the need of some IT person for updating the shown rackets and a second one which involves a more extensive solution which will provide the already mentioned user interface and some <strong>extra features</strong> such as rackets management by site&rsquo;s administrators, custom rackets creation in each user account, temporary rackets creation for on site sales person - customer interaction&hellip; As well, in this approach a <strong>better adaptability and flexibility</strong> for development is offered enabling an easy and fast way of adding new features. Another reason why this approach is the recommended one is the <strong>flexibility that gives</strong> you, as the webshop owner, to choose which rackets you want to display on the graph and tailor that information depending on your business needs and goals.</p>
<p>Either of both approaches can be successfully met due to the set of skills used and acquired in such type of projects like the built of a complete CRM for a physiotherapy clinic which can be found <a href="https://danielmolinar.github.io/en/projects/fortia"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> or the excelling interface developments skills which can be found <a href="https://danielmolinar.github.io/en/projects/crazy-pit-stop"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Along those projects years of <a href="https://danielmolinar.github.io/en/experience"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a> back the needed set of skills for this solution.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-1">
  Proposal #1:
  <a class="heading-link" href="#proposal-1">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>This proposal encapsulates the development of the user interface including the filter, the graph and the list of products in a responsive way, meaning a usable and reliable interface for multiple devices. Some functionalities won&rsquo;t be developed due to this approach, such as, the administrator panel for managing the shown rackets. The displayed data will come from a file injected into the website through code. This solution would be part of the current padelshop website, and it won&rsquo;t need any additional hosting platform.</p>

  </a>
</h3>
<p>This solution would be summed up into one final deliverable which will be the user interface integrated and functional into padelshop&rsquo;s website. For that, during all the development a shopify account of the website would be needed.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the deliverables included in the service proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li><ins>Kick-off:</ins> Kick-off meeting and goals definition.</li>
<li><ins>Exploration:</ins> Exploration of the website&rsquo;s code and familiarization with it.</li>
<li><ins>Design:</ins> User interface design proposals for multiple devices and feedback.</li>
<li><ins>Data management:</ins> Management of the current rackets measurement data to code friendly.</li>
<li><ins>Development:</ins> Once the design is agreed the development of the solution will take place.</li>
<li><ins>Website Launch:</ins> Once everything is built and approved the final product will be launched in the current padelshop website as a new entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Timeline would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><ins>Phase 1:</ins></strong> Kick-off &amp; Exploration</li>
<li><strong><ins>Phase 2:</ins></strong> Design, Data management &amp; Development</li>

</h2>
<p>This second proposal is based on improvements and added features that could be of interest to the client. The solution includes the approach defined in <a href="http://danielmolinar.github.io/en/proposals/padelshop/#proposal-1"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal #1</a> and the development of an external API/service which will provide one point of access and management to the data of the rackets which will be stored in a database. This approach has added value such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rackets and data management from an administrator portal where only the client will have access allowing him to have full control over the shown rackets and the data without the need of IT knowledge.</li>
<li>Users will be able to create and delete custom rackets into their own graph.</li>
<li>Logging and monitoring will be built for better maintenance and error solving as well as security rules.</li>
<li>Enabling a new world of future developments and additional features (i.e. storing which filters the user has applied for the creation of customized newsletters and more).</li>
</ul>

    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>This solution is more time extensive but a better approach from the business point of view since it will give the client full control of the data and decouple himself from the need of someone with IT knowledge. The process is summed up into two deliverables, the first one would be the user interface with the filter, graph and list of rackets and a second one which will include the rackets creation from the website and the administrator panel for the management of the data. For most of the development a Shopify account will be needed, and a new host platform will be required for the external API/service and Database at the end of the first deliverable.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the deliverables included in the service proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li><ins>Kick-off:</ins> Kick-off meeting and goals definition.</li>
<li><ins>Exploration:</ins> Exploration of the website&rsquo;s code and familiarization with it.</li>
<li><ins>Design:</ins> User interface design proposals for multiple devices and feedback.</li>
<li><ins>Data management:</ins> Management of the current rackets measurement data into the database.</li>
<li><ins>Graph Interface development:</ins> Once the design is agreed the development of the interface will take place excluding the feature of adding new rackets.</li>
<li><ins>Data Reading Development:</ins> The server development will include the database connection and the endpoint (entry point) to retrieve the rackets and the measurement data.</li>
<li><ins>First Deliverable Launch:</ins> Once the previous steps are built and approved the first deliverable product will be launched in the current padelshop website as a new entry.</li>
<li><ins>Racket Creation Interface Development:</ins> Following the previous agreed design will take the development of the racket addition interface.</li>
<li><ins>Data management Server Development:</ins> Extending the previous development now the endpoints to delete, update and create rackets will be added along user authorization, data validation and request rate limit as a good practices for keeping a safe and reliable development.</li>
<li><ins>Administrator Panel development:</ins> The administrator panel development will take place.</li>
<li><ins>Final Launch:</ins> Includes website new release launch with the new feature and administrator panel launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Timeline would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><ins>Phase1 1:</ins></strong> Kick-off &amp; Exploration</li>
<li><strong><ins>Phase 2:</ins></strong> Design &amp; Data management</li>
