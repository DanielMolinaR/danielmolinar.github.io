Experience level **\< JUNIOR />**

In my beginings at Taiger I focused in automation scripting with **Python** and **DevOps** tasks such as:

 - Client side deployments
 - Cloud deployments in the main cloud providers like AWS, GCP and Azure mainly
 - Docker's images management and kubernetes suites creation

Lately I was assigned a development project for our biggest client at that moment. Together with the team we developed  a service in **Kotlin** which consumed Azure's and our main product's API. Along the development of the service we focused ourselves in the **SOLID** principles implementation as well as using design patterns whenever we thought they were applicable. Another of our main focus where the **eficiency and performance** since it had to process a great amount of parallel API calls. We also implemented **unit and integration tests** for our business logic.

During the development of the project we created different pipelines for the deployment and releases versioning
