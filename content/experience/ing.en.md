Experience level **\< MEDIOR />**

As a Software Engineer at ING Bank, I've been on a thrilling journey of innovation and problem-solving since August 2022. My primary focus has been on harnessing the power of **Golang** to develop a **robust API**. This API plays a pivotal role in streamlining first-day and second-day business operations, serving as the backbone of efficiency for our team.

In our pursuit of excellence, my team and I have meticulously integrated essential elements such as **logging, tracing, testing, and security scanning** into our development process. We understand the critical importance of reliability and security in financial systems, and every line of code reflects our commitment to these principles.

Adopting an agile methodology with SCRUM, we thrive in an environment that values collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement. Working alongside talented individuals, we embark on diverse projects that cater to the evolving needs of our department.

One notable achievement at the begining of my employment has been the creation of the roots of a dynamic **web portal using Python**. This portal acts as a centralized hub, seamlessly integrating multiple tools and developments within our department. By harnessing the power of Python, we've empowered our team to access, utilize, and optimize our resources more efficiently than ever before.

In our quest for operational excellence, we leverage the **Azure environment** for project version control and **CI/CD**. Utilizing **Azure DevOps** Repositories and **Azure Pipelines**, we ensure the smooth and efficient delivery of our projects, adhering to the highest standards of quality and reliability.

My experience at ING Bank has been for now nothing short of transformative. It's not just about writing code; it's about driving meaningful change, enhancing efficiency, and shaping the future of banking operations.
